## 🔄 Stages

- **contact** — We are trying to reach the original author to arrange a transfer.

More stages will be added as needed.

## ➕ Adding a Crate

If you know a crate that’s important but **abandoned** or **archived**, you can request RS-CA to manage it.

1. **Open an issue** in this repository: [Managed Crates Issues](https://github.com/rs-ca/managed-crates/issues)  
2. Include:
   - Crate name
   - crates.io link
   - Original repository link
   - Reason for adoption
3. The RS-CA team will review, attempt contact with the author, and proceed according to our [process](#-management-process).

💡 **Want a crate to be prioritized?**  
Give a 👍 **upvote** on the relevant issue. Crates with more community interest are reviewed first.

## 🛠 Management Process

1. **Contact** the original author to request a transfer.
2. If transfer is not possible, **hard fork** the repository.
3. Maintain the crate under RS-CA stewardship.
4. Archive the original version for historical reference.
